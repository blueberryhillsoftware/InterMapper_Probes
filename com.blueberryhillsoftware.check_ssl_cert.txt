\G\Check SSL Certificate for expiration\p\ 

Check an SSL Certificate on a server and verify that its expiration date is sufficiently far away. 

\b\Parameters\p\

The thresholds of \i\Warning\p\ and \i\Critical\p\ specify the number of days before the device gives warning and critical alerts. The defaults are 30 and 10 days, respectively.

The \i\Additional\p\ pararmeter can be used to add more options to the test. 

This probe invokes the \u4=http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Network-Protocols/HTTP/check_ssl_cert/details\Nagios check_ssl_cert plugin\p0\ to verify the SSL Certificate. See the check_ssl_cert plugin's page for more details.

\u4=http://blueberryhillsoftware.com/check_ssl_cert-probe-for-intermapper\Check for updates\p0\ to this probe.

\i\Note:\p\ The default polling interval for this probe is six hours - the checks don't need to happen very often.
